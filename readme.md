# 1. In a few sentences,  explain the structure of my project.

1_ First of all, I could not manage to finish this project untill the end (with the delete button and the checkbox).These are the steps I followed while working on this project :
- For starting, as usual , I crated the necessary HTML and styling it, also I created the arrays of objects in js.
- I began my work by using the fundamental approach to map through the arrays of object, followed by crating a new HTML and pushing the values from the map into that HTML, so that we can show the lists of the books for the users. All of these steps were done inside of a function.
- What's more, I grabbed all the imputs elements in oreder to get the values from the users. After that, I created a new function and inside I created a new object, which contains the values from the user. I pushed the new object into the big arrays of object, and then, I created the HTML for that to show the list of the books with the new one.
- I could mange to store the user's imput into the local storage
- I tried to activate the delete button but did not succeed nor the checkbox.

## 2. If you had more time, what area of your project would you improve?

- I would improve the area of local storage. I did it but I still do not really understand very well how it works.
- On top of that, I do really need to improve my understanding on what to use according to what the goal is and how to do that.That was my weakest point during this project. Probably, I need to watch the videos more often.

## 3. Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

- Yes, I do learn new this while working on this project: such as, how to create a simle but useful HTML, how to debug by myself.

## 4. What was the most challenging part for you?

- The most challenging for me was accessing the values from the user and pushing them into the new object for me to show the new version lists.

## 5. Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?

- If it is possible, I really need a new explanation for the local storage and the event delegation for the delete button.

## 6. Any other comments?

- Thanks for giving us some guidance for this week end project, it was helpful.
Please, could you us more theory while we are watching every single videos, in order to boost our understanding.
